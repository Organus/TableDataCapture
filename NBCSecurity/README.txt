The SpreadSheet project was created by James Albersheim and David Crocker.
The application is made to allow an administrator to select a block of data from a spreadsheet and load it into a database along with metadata.  It also archives the spreadsheet file.  The system also works on many other data types such as tab delimited files and NetCDF files.  This application is best used as the basis for procedures that use spreadsheets with identical structures for structuring data from a process.  For instance, if a timesheet were created within a spreadsheet then the application could be configured to repeatedly ingest spreadsheets of this type to capture work hours for a business.
Funding was provided by the US Department of Energy/EERE/Office of Biomass Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Server names and login information have been scrubbed.  They will need to be configured to work properly.
This was project was developed on MyEclipse.
There is no support for this application.  It is published to provide the public access to the code.  See the license for details of use.
The unit tests are out of date and would need to be heavily edited to become usable.
The response time for Internet Explorer is bad.  But it has worked fine for Firefox and for Safari.
